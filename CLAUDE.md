# Radio Reads / Scaling Engine

## Mission

This website collects books which have been **discussed or reviewed** on a radio show, or where the **author has been interviewed** about an upcoming book, or otherwise noted (e.g. they've won a notable prize).

**Perfect user**: Someone who listened to the radio yesterday, heard a book being discussed, but missed what it was and wants to find out more. Or someone looking for a gift who knows Radio 4 is a great source for books.

**We want**: Books that are the _subject_ of the segment - discussed, reviewed, prize-winners, author interviews. Require author + book title (or clear book-type signal: "novel", "book", "short story collection").

**We do NOT want**: Books mentioned only in adaptation context (film, theatre, TV, musical, play) - e.g. "Lord of the Flies adaptation", "A Christmas Carol transformed into hip hop dance", "musical based on Harold Fry". Also exclude TV/film titles mistaken for books (e.g. "thriller Lurker" = TV show).
