        Radio Reads tracks books discussed, reviewed and recommended on radio
        programmes. Each episode is checked for books that are the subject of the
        conversation — author interviews, reviews, prize announcements — and
        added to a searchable archive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project currently covers BBC Radio 4 shows including Front Row,
        Bookclub and Free Thinking.
